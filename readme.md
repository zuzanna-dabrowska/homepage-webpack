# Overthinking - a simple example of page using WTF Webpack Starter Kit 

My project implements Webpack - simple html, scss and js.
What is more you can find there grid, flexbox, menu and *hidden* dark-mode.

## How to use it?

Click on `Use this template` button to generate a new repository based on this starter kit. After that clone it to your computer, go to the project directory in console and type `npm install`.

## Available scripts

`npm run start` - runs development mode

`npm run build` - runs build process for production

`npm run publish` - runs build process and publish the page using `gh-pages` branch

***Enjoy!***

# Overthinking - a simple example of page using WTF Webpack Starter Kit 

My project contains simple html, scss and js.
What is more you can find there grid, flexbox, menu and *hidden* dark-mode.
An important part is also adjusting the project to mobile devices.

## How to use it?

Scroll through the page, use menu on mobile phones, try the dark mode.

## Available scripts

To see the dark mode you should click on https://zuzanna-dabrowska.github.io/homepage-webpack/dark-mode.html , it is hidden in the main menu.

***Enjoy!***
